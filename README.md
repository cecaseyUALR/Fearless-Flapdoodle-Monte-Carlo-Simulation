# Fearless-Flapdoodle-Monte-Carlo-Simulation

This program uses random number generation to simulate the different
	directions that Fearless Flapdoodle takes at random on an 10 x 10 area island.
	The island houses a spring to replenish his thirst, an airport to take him home,
	a cannibal village, giving both Flapdoodle and his cannibal captors a "taste" of fear.
	
	Other possible deaths include thirst (100 steps after last spring visit),
	hunger (300 total steps without success), and drowning (going off the 10 x 10 grid).
	In this program, I calculate the probability of each of Flapdoodle's possible
	fates, and the average number of steps on a successful simulation.
